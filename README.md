Simple static site generator in Haskell.
There is Hakyll. But you know: to productively use Hakyll, you have to know Haskell well. It's a prerequisite. And as I'm only starting with this language, it's worth writing your own "Hakyll" to learn the things.

I learn Haskell intensively while writing it, so if there is something ugly please contribute and point me at the problems. :)
