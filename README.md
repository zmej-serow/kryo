# kryo

A simple static site generator in Haskell.

Yep, there *is* Hakyll. But you know: to productively use Hakyll, you have to know Haskell well. It's a prerequisite. And as I'm only starting with this language, it's worth writing your **own small "Hakyll"** to learn the things.

I learn Haskell intensively while writing it, so if there is something ugly please contribute and point me at the problems. :)
